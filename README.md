## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on networking series, I'm learning about building a complete virtual private cloud (VPC), which forms the backbone of secure and scalable cloud applications. By the end of the 9 projects, I will Built a secure VPC architecture from scratch Connected resources across different network environments, Implemented network security and monitoring, Created 9 pieces of portfolio-worthy documentation that showcase your cloud networking skills!

I'm learning about cloud networking because. I want to add AWS networking experience to my resume - so many job descriptions ask for VPC knowledge.

Businesses traditionally had to build their own physical networks. Cloud networking changed things by allowing for faster deployment of services, easier management of resources, and reduced operational costs.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will set aside goals to complete VPC projects.  I will keep myself accountable by and practices everytime to master Networking. My reward is building confidence working with AWS networking and give myself valuable skills to showcase in my career.

### What are networks?

A computer network is a collection of devices that can exchange data packets.These data packets travel between devices using IP addresses as destinations. As the packets move through the network, they create network traffic.

### What is a VPC?

A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is like your own private section of the AWS network, where you control the flow of network traffic in and out of the AWS resources inside.  This helps organizations by carefully designing their VPC because it determines:
Who can access their applications
How secure their customer data will be
How their different services communicate with each other
Whether their applications can connect to the internet
How traffic flows between different parts of their system
